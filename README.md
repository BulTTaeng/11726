# "11726"

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/11726/blob/main/11726_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming (recurrence relation)

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It was easy to find recurrence relation, but I don't expect that long long type will over flow.

I changed it to save mod 10007 in the dp array and it solves.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
